# Ingot

Ingot is a programming language designed for Minecraft datapack development. It is designed to be a high-level language that compiles down to mcfunction files.

This is just the language specification. For the compiler, see [BlastFurnace](https://github.com/hanmindev/blastfurnace-docs).

Much of the syntax and semantics are inspired by Rust, C, and Python.

WARNING: This language is in active development and is not yet stable. The syntax and semantics are subject to change.
